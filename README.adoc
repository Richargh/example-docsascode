= Docs-as-Code Arc42 and ADR Example

An example project that demonstrates how to convert AsciiDoc to HTML using the Asciidoctor Gradle plugin.
The project includes the Arc42 architecture template (which can be found https://arc42.org/download[online])
and uses http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[architecture decision records (ADR)] to record architecture decisions.
